# turtle-sincos
Get acquainted with turtle using Stephen Grupetta's sin-cos example:
https://thepythoncodingbook.com/2022/05/08/do-you-really-know-what-sines-and-cosines-are-visualising-maths-using-python-and-turtle/

## Usage
```shell
python3 sincos.py
```

## Differences
Stephen Grupetta's original code is in `sincos_orig.py`. During the implementation I have refactored the code such that it uses functions and classes which shall be more reusable than everything in the main scope. The resulting code is however a few lines longer than the original. I am not perfectly happy about its look and feel, but it is a start.
